# Development

Make sure to have your environment variables on place by runnning

```sh
cp env.sample .env
```

You will need to have `cryptography` dependency in order for this to work properly

Make sure to install `python` and then `pip`

```sh
sudo easy_install pip
```

Finally,

```sh
pip install cryptography
```
